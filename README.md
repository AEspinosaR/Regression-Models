Coursera Regression Models repository
In this project we will explore the relationship between a set of variables and Miles per Gallon (MPG). We are particularly interested in these two questions
1. Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG2. Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions
For this study we will use ```mtcars``` R dataset
